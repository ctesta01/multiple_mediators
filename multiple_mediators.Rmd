# Introduction {.tabset .tabset-dropdown}

The following approaches are taken from [*Mediation Analysis with
Multiple Mediators* by Tyler VanderWeele and Stijn Vansteelandt (2014)](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/em-2012-0010/html).

Below are two approaches for dealing with multiple mediators: a regression 
based approach and a weighting-based approach.
